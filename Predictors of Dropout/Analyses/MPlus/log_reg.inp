! Removed items 24 & 29 because there were not many people who chose and caused a lot of missing cells.

!item 24 = child is learning esl"
! Item 29 = child is involved in a gang. 
! These 2 items don't quite characterize our population.

	Missing = all(-1234) ;

!Question for Kim: I don't understand how to incorporate control variables

!Item 24 = "This child is learning english as a second language"
