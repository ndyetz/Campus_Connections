This shiny web application displays the Campus Connections Social Networks. You can separate it by Semester, year, and time point. 
Watch the network grow! 

The app it self is available on my shinyapps web server. [CLICK HERE](https://ndyetz.shinyapps.io/CC_SN/)  to play around with it. 

I will be updating this as I utilize the CC social network in my research. If you are interested in analyzing the Campus Connections Network please do not hesitate to let me know. I am hoping to inspire others to utilize Social Networks in their research. When I have time, I will create another section to add attributes and eventually make it interactive so people can play around with the network. I want to inspire YOU! Social Network Analysis is COOL! I'm also a nerd. Oh well.
